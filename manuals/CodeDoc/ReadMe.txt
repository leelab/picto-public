The contents of the html directory are the code documentation from January 26, 2014.  They were copied directly from output/documentation/main/html.  We did this so that a copy of the html documentation would be available in the online github repository.  Otherwise, people would have to do a whole lot of work just to get to the point where they can see the code documentation that is supposed to help get people started in the first place.
