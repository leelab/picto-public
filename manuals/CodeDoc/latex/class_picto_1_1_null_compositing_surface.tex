A compositing surface that doesn't do anything.  




{\ttfamily \#include $<$Null\-Compositing\-Surface.\-h$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
A compositing surface that doesn't do anything. 

This would seem to be a total waste of time, but a null compositing surface can actually be really useful. With a traditional compositing surface, an experiment can only run as fast as we can render it. With a null surface the engine can run an experiment as fast as the C\-P\-U allows. This means that we can use a null compositing surface while analyzing an experiment.

Joey\-: When actually creating the \hyperlink{class_picto_1_1_analysis}{Analysis} system, we didn't actually use this, but it might be interesting to see if using this type of method could speed things up when using Run\-To\-End in the Playback\-Viewer.
