\subsection{Detailed Description}
A file select button used to choose a file from disk. 

This widget is used in the \hyperlink{class_property_browser}{Property\-Browser} for design elements that require a file path to be selected. The widget is a simple button that when pressed opens a file dialog. Before a file has been selected, the button label is \char`\"{}\-Select File\char`\"{}, after a file has been selected, the name of the file is used for the label. The Property that this widget interacts with stores the file path. When we use this in \hyperlink{namespace_picto}{Picto}, the Design Element typically checks to see when the File Path Property changes, and when it does, it updates the contents of separate Data Property that actually stores the file contents. \begin{DoxySeeAlso}{See Also}

Constructs a new \hyperlink{class_file_select_widget}{File\-Select\-Widget}. 

manager and property are used to set/get the value of the underlying file path property. editor\-State was originally used to include this property's contents in searches; however, it looks like we stopped supporting that, so we can probably remove it.
