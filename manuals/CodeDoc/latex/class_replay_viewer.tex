\subsection{Detailed Description}
Defines the U\-I for the \hyperlink{class_replay_viewer}{Replay\-Viewer}. 

The \hyperlink{class_replay_viewer}{Replay\-Viewer} includes a number of components. It has a main display area where Session playback is viewed. There is a timing bar underneath the main area that shows the current playback position within a Session Run and allows the user to move around within the Session to different times. A speed slider is provided alongside the main area to define the playback speed. Sessions are loaded by pressing a button in the toolbar. A single or multiple Sessions may be loaded from the dialog that pops up. A Run\-Selector\-Widget is used to select which Runs will be played back / analyzed. Multiple Runs can be selected in this \hyperlink{class_viewer}{Viewer} from the multiple Sessions loaded to define a batch analysis. An Analysis\-Selector\-Widget is used to define which Analyses to run during Run playback, be they local Analyses, built into the Session's Design, or imported Analyses that are added to the Design at playback time. Finally, an Output\-Widget\-Holderis used to hold the Analysis\-Output\-Widgets that contain the output from the analyses. This widget allows the user to save the output to a file path. Alternatively, the user can use a \char`\"{}run to 
end\char`\"{} button when running a Session run. When they do this, a message box will give the user the option to save the Analysis Output automatically at the end of the Run, and they can set up the save file path there. This is particularly useful when analyzing a batch of Runs, in which case all Runs' outputs are saved to the same parent directory.

Pauses the current Run, or starts the selected Run in a paused state (at time zero). 

If the function causes a Run to start, and that Run's Session has not yet been loaded, this will cause the Session to load and then the \char`\"{}start by pausing\char`\"{} will be enacted.

Causes playback/analysis to run completely from the beginning to the end of each selected run at maximum speed, no rendering, and without any opportunity for user interaction during the course of playback. 

This is meant to be used when only Analysis is needed, and it is not important to be able to watch the Session on screen. When this function is called and Analysis objects are active, this function asks if the user would like to automatically save Analysis outputs when each Run is complete. This is important because otherwise in batch analysis each new Run Analysis would overwrite previous Analysis outputs and the user would only be able to save Analysis output of the last Run in the batch.
