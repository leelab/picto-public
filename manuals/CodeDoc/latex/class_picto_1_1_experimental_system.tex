Unimplemented. Stores information about the Experimental system being used

It makes sense to record the experimental setup being used for each experiment. This class will eventually provide that capability. I am envisioning it as a container that stores all of the other equipment classes (Audio, Behvioral, etc). Ideally, these classes will all collect their setup info in a completely automated fashion. However, it seems likely that we will require input from the user for some of them (e.\-g. it is unlikely that we will be able to determine the subject's position without asking the user) We will need to come up with some sort of scheme that isn't too intrusive (no one wants to fill out 20 pages of junk efor each experiment), but also that actually gets up to date info (maybe require the user to update once a week?)
