\subsection{Detailed Description}
Handles T\-A\-S\-K commands. 

Picto\-Workstation send T\-A\-S\-K commands when it wants a remote \hyperlink{class_director}{Director} instance to change the current state of a task (start, stop, pause, etc). It is also used to alter Experimental Property values (init values) during runtime, provide information about an operator click in the viewer window, trigger a reward, and change the notes, name or saved value of a Task Run. Essentially, this is the Workstation's interface to a running session.

Handles T\-A\-S\-K commands. 

T\-A\-S\-K commands are commands that the Workstation sends to cause something to happen in the Session. They are defined in the target of the command and include\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item start\-: Start the task with the name after the colon in the command header
\item pause\-: Pause the currently running task
\item stop\-: Stop the currently running task
\item resume\-: Resume the currently running task
\item reward\-: Supply a reward on the reward channel after the colon in the command header. If the command has content, use the number in the content to update the default reward duration for the channel.
\item isauthorized\-: Checks if the Workstation sending the command is authorized to use other Task commands. If not an unauthorized Response will be returned. If so, an O\-K response will be returned.
\item parameter\-: Update the init\-Value of the Property with the Asset\-Id printed after the command header's colon. Change it to the value included in the command content.
\item click\-: Inform the \hyperlink{class_director}{Director} that an Operator click occured at the coordinates included after the command header's colon.
\item updatedata\-: Change the saved Task\-Run information to the serialized value included in the command contents. This is useful for adding notes, changing the name or changing the saved value of a Session's Task Run.
\end{DoxyItemize}

This function processes all of these commands, adds appropriate Directives for the \hyperlink{class_director}{Director} when necessary, changes Session data when necessary, and returns appropriate information when necessary.
