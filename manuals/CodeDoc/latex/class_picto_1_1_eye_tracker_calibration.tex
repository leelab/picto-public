\subsection{Detailed Description}
This class is no longer used since \hyperlink{class_picto_1_1_calibration}{Calibration} is now handled in the form of a \hyperlink{class_picto_1_1_task}{Task} that is automatically added to every new experiment. The original documentation appears below\-: 

\hyperlink{class_picto_1_1_calibration}{Calibration} tool for the eye tracker

The \hyperlink{class_picto_1_1_eye_tracker_calibration}{Eye\-Tracker\-Calibration} object provides the framework for calibrating the eyetracker. There are two different calibration modes provided. The automatic mode displays targets and gives rewards in a way that automatically generates the calibration constants. The manual mode displays targets in response to user input and allows the user to set the calibration constants by hand.

Additionally, there are automatic and manual test modes that allow the user to confirm that the calibration is accurate.

It should be noted that this object handles all of the hardware interaction, but of the user interface and G\-U\-I (apart from displaying graphics on the subject's screen).

W\-A\-R\-N\-I\-N\-G\-: As of September 1, 2010 this code has never been tested and was all commented out. We will want to have some sort of automated (or semi-\/automated) eye tracker calibration tool. It is possible that we will want to build it as a state machine instead of having it as a built-\/in \hyperlink{namespace_picto}{Picto} component. We should also actually write the \hyperlink{class_picto_1_1_calibration}{Calibration} base class and use it here.
