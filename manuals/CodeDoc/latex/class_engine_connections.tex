\subsection{Detailed Description}
Sets up the connections between the engine and the front panel. 

This used to be a more important class than it is now. The only thing that it does at this point is set up the socket used to send commands from the Front Panel application to the \hyperlink{class_director}{Director} application, and set that socket into the \hyperlink{class_front_panel_info}{Front\-Panel\-Info} object. It should probably be simplified, at some point. In particular, the event\-Channel is no longer used. \begin{DoxyAuthor}{Author}
