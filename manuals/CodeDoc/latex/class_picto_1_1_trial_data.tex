Unimplemented. This was supposed to contain information about a trial like the \char`\"{}trial blob\char`\"{} in Orion. We no longer require a Trial structure in \hyperlink{namespace_picto}{Picto} though, and all data is stored in the Session file such that the designer doesn't need to define what data needs to be stored.
