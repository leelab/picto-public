\subsection{Detailed Description}
Unimplemented. This class should probably be removed. The original documentation appears below\-: 

Intended to store data about the session.

The functionality that was intended to end up here, ended up mostly in the \hyperlink{class_session_info}{Session\-Info} object . It might makes sense to split some of it out, but I'm not totally sure.
