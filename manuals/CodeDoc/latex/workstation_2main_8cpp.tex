\subsection{Detailed Description}
The Workstation application. \hyperlink{namespace_picto}{Picto} workstation is the operator's interface into the \hyperlink{namespace_picto}{Picto} System. It handles everything that the operator could possibly want to do. It's features include\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A State\-Machine\-Editor -\/ A graphical state machine based development environment that is used to design \hyperlink{namespace_picto}{Picto} Experiments and their Analysis.
\item A \hyperlink{class_test_viewer}{Test\-Viewer} -\/ A test environment where Experiments and Analyses can be run and debugged before being deployed in a real experimental Session.
\item A \hyperlink{class_remote_viewer}{Remote\-Viewer} -\/ A control panel that is used to start an experimental session on a Director/\-Proxy system, view it in real time, control its operation, and interact with the experiment subject.
\item A \hyperlink{class_replay_viewer}{Replay\-Viewer} -\/ A playback system that allows for replaying completed experimental Sessions, recording their activity to video, running Analysis on the Sessions, and saving the Analysis output to disk.
\end{DoxyItemize}

While each of these Workstation \char`\"{}\-Viewers\char`\"{} functions to a great extent in its own world, there are some loose ties between all Viewers. The main tie between all of these viewers is a \char`\"{}current design file.\char`\"{} The Workstation as whole always has a design file loaded. The Design stored in the design file's X\-M\-L has different functions in each \hyperlink{class_viewer}{Viewer}. In the State\-Machine\-Editor, the design is what is being created and edited. In the \hyperlink{class_test_viewer}{Test\-Viewer} the design is what is being run and tested. In the \hyperlink{class_remote_viewer}{Remote\-Viewer} the design is what is being sent over to a \hyperlink{class_director}{Director} in order to run an experimental Session. In the \hyperlink{class_replay_viewer}{Replay\-Viewer}, the design defines the Analyses that can be imported into the currently loaded Session files in order to gather data that may not have been considered when a Session was first run. \begin{DoxyAuthor}{Author}

The main method of the \hyperlink{namespace_picto}{Picto} Workstation application. 

Goes through standard \hyperlink{namespace_picto}{Picto} application setup procedure, setting up the Q\-Application, the Q\-Translator, and calling \hyperlink{namespace_picto_ab626f6cf7953f6f0c2947f0f03b8e62e}{Picto\-::\-Initialize\-Lib()} and Picto\-::\-Iniitialize\-Ports(), then sets up the Auto\-Updater (\hyperlink{class_update_downloader}{Update\-Downloader}) system with the commands that will be needed to restart this application and its top level window (so that it can correctly close the window during restart). Next the top level \hyperlink{class_main_window}{Main\-Window} is displayed and the application is executed by calling Q\-Application\-::exec(), which only returns when the \hyperlink{class_main_window}{Main\-Window} is closed. \begin{DoxyAuthor}{Author}
