A lot has changed since the original \hyperlink{namespace_picto}{Picto} Playback Design, this class was part of an attempt to make code of different \hyperlink{class_picto_1_1_data_state}{Data\-State} types very reusable. In the end, more code reusability led to less efficiency in terms of timing and memory space and we opted for a more tailored approach with each of the \hyperlink{class_picto_1_1_data_state}{Data\-State} classes doing a lot more of its own work to handle the \hyperlink{class_picto_1_1_data_state}{Data\-State} interface in the most efficient way possible.

In the end, more code reusability led to less efficiency in terms of timing and memory space and we opted for a more tailored approach with each of the \hyperlink{class_picto_1_1_data_state}{Data\-State} classes doing a lot more of its own work to handle the \hyperlink{class_picto_1_1_data_state}{Data\-State} interface in the most efficient way possible. 

We should probably remove this code. But the original comments appear below for reference.
