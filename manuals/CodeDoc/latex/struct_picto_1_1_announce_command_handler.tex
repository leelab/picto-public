This was meant to handle A\-N\-N\-O\-U\-N\-C\-E commands, but since they are an integral part of the Server\-Discovery system in the \hyperlink{class_director}{Director} and Proxy, handling of A\-N\-N\-O\-U\-N\-C\-E commands ended up getting hard coded into the \hyperlink{struct_picto_1_1_server_discoverer}{Server\-Discoverer} and \hyperlink{class_picto_1_1_command_channel}{Command\-Channel} classes.

\subsection{Detailed Description}
This was meant to handle A\-N\-N\-O\-U\-N\-C\-E commands, but since they are an integral part of the Server\-Discovery system in the \hyperlink{class_director}{Director} and Proxy, handling of A\-N\-N\-O\-U\-N\-C\-E commands ended up getting hard coded into the \hyperlink{struct_picto_1_1_server_discoverer}{Server\-Discoverer} and \hyperlink{class_picto_1_1_command_channel}{Command\-Channel} classes. 

Using this \hyperlink{struct_picto_1_1_announce_command_handler}{Announce\-Command\-Handler} to handle the A\-N\-N\-O\-U\-N\-C\-E commands was actually a pretty good idea though so it might be worthwhile at some point to try to clean things up so that A\-N\-N\-O\-U\-N\-C\-E handling isn't hard coded into anything. \begin{DoxyAuthor}{Author}
