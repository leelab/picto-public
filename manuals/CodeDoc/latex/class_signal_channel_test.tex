A test class for playing with signal channels.

This class is no longer used and should probably be deleted. This was a test class that was written to test out a signal channel. It draws a circle on the screen, and moves it around according to the inputs from the signal channel. This is actually a really good place to start reading if you're trying to understand either signal channels, or the compositing system. \begin{DoxyAuthor}{Author}
