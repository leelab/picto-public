\subsection{Detailed Description}
A Widget used with the \hyperlink{class_replay_viewer}{Replay\-Viewer} to set the current playback speed. 

This widget consists of a Slider bar and a numerical field. To change the speed setting, the slider can be dragged or the numerical field can be updated. Each of these updates the other automatically. The widget's max and min can be set along with its resoltion, where the resolution value is the minimum value increment. The widget is set up so that a speed of 1 (normal playback) is in the center of the slider. The space between the center and the bottom moves playback from 1 to 0. The space between the middle of the slider and the top moves playback from 1 to 100. The playback speed value is interpreted by the \hyperlink{class_replay_viewer}{Replay\-Viewer} as a factor by which playback speed is multiplied. Therefore, a playback speed of 3 means that playback will occur at 3 times the normal rate. A value of .5 means that playback will occur at half the normal rate. \begin{DoxyAuthor}{Author}
