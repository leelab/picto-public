\subsection{Detailed Description}
This is used with the \hyperlink{class_playback_controller}{Playback\-Controller} to run Session playback in a non G\-U\-I thread. 

When Q\-Thread\-::start() is called, \hyperlink{class_playback_thread_a5dbdc1173cb9c01c0782a53f21126340}{run()} gets called in a new thread. \hyperlink{class_playback_thread_a5dbdc1173cb9c01c0782a53f21126340}{run()} just emits the init() signal starts an event loop during which the update() signal is emitted repeatedly. Other objects use the \hyperlink{class_playback_thread}{Playback\-Thread} so that they can run some of their functions in its thread. To do this, they use Q\-Object\-::move\-To\-Thread(), then attach slots to the init() and update() signals accordingly. \begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Objects that want functions to run in this thread need to use Q\-Object\-::move\-To\-Thread() because if they don'y Qt will simply queue up calls to init() and update() and run them in the event queue of the thread that the object belongs to.

Impliments Q\-Thread\-::run() to emit an init() signal, then emit an update() signal repeatedly. 

This is meant to be used with other objects so that they can run some of their functions in this thread. To do this, they would use Q\-Object\-::move\-To\-Thread(), then attach slots to the init() and update() signals accordingly. \begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
