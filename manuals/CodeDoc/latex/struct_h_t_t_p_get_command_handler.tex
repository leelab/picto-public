\subsection{Detailed Description}
Handles G\-E\-T commands from the H\-T\-T\-P protocol. 

This command handler was used during testing, but isn't really part of \hyperlink{namespace_picto}{Picto} at this point. It responds to G\-E\-T commands sent using H\-T\-T\-P protocol (instead of P\-I\-C\-T\-O). Actually, if you are so inclined, Picto\-Server can be used as a web server. This isn't currently being done, but it could prove useful for certain applications. (e.\-g. streaming \char`\"{}video\char`\"{} of an ongoing experiment to a destination that doesn't have a copy of Picto\-Workstation, and doesn't need to be able to control an experiment). \begin{DoxyAuthor}{Author}
