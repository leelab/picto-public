<p>This is the Developer's Guide for the Picto suite of experimental control applications and associated PictoBox hardware. If you are an investigator utilizing the software as part of your research then you probably want the PictoManual.docx located in Picto\manuals. If you are modifying or attempting to build a Pictobox, you want the PictoboxDocumentation.docx from Picto\manuals. If you are interested in learning how the system itself works and/or modifying the system, then this guide is the right place to start.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="devdocs_getting_started_introduction"></a>
Introduction</h1>
<p>The Picto suite of experimental control applications is utilized by researchers to perform neurobiological experiments in the study of decision making. The system consists of serveral components:</p><ul>
<li>The <a class="el" href="class_director.html" title="Defines an object that runs a Picto Experiment for a test subject, transmits experimental data to the...">Director</a> component runs the experimental "game" that the test subject "plays." This component takes in user input from a mouse input, eye tracker, joystick, or any other device that can provide analog x/y data. Inputs are monitored to control the flow of the "game" and all user input, reward, and experimental state data are sent over the network to the Picto <a class="el" href="class_server.html" title="The Server object managing the actual incoming connections and ServerThread generation for the PictoS...">Server</a> Component. A hardware line connects the <a class="el" href="class_director.html" title="Defines an object that runs a Picto Experiment for a test subject, transmits experimental data to the...">Director</a> to the Proxy component and an alignment code is sent over this line periodically for the purpose of time alignment.</li>
<li>The Proxy component (<a class="el" href="class_proxy_main_window.html" title="The main window of the proxy server. ">ProxyMainWindow</a>) runs on a neural data acquisition computer (currently supported models are Plexon and TDT). It collects data from the acquisition system, including neural spikes, local field potential data and alignment codes coming in from the <a class="el" href="class_director.html" title="Defines an object that runs a Picto Experiment for a test subject, transmits experimental data to the...">Director</a>, repackages the data and sends it over the network to the Picto <a class="el" href="class_server.html" title="The Server object managing the actual incoming connections and ServerThread generation for the PictoS...">Server</a> component.</li>
<li>The Picto <a class="el" href="class_server.html" title="The Server object managing the actual incoming connections and ServerThread generation for the PictoS...">Server</a> component is the main hub of the application suite. This component takes in data from the Proxy and <a class="el" href="class_director.html" title="Defines an object that runs a Picto Experiment for a test subject, transmits experimental data to the...">Director</a>, aligns the timestreams from the two components based on the alignment codes and saves the data to disk in a Session file. It also makes Director/Proxy data available in real time for monitoring from the Workstation component. Lastly, the Picto <a class="el" href="class_server.html" title="The Server object managing the actual incoming connections and ServerThread generation for the PictoS...">Server</a> acts as the glue that binds the Workstation to the Proxy and <a class="el" href="class_director.html" title="Defines an object that runs a Picto Experiment for a test subject, transmits experimental data to the...">Director</a>. Whenever the Workstation sends a command to be handled on either the Proxy or the <a class="el" href="class_director.html" title="Defines an object that runs a Picto Experiment for a test subject, transmits experimental data to the...">Director</a>, the command is sent to the <a class="el" href="class_server.html" title="The Server object managing the actual incoming connections and ServerThread generation for the PictoS...">Server</a>. The <a class="el" href="class_server.html" title="The Server object managing the actual incoming connections and ServerThread generation for the PictoS...">Server</a> takes care of forwarding the command to the appropriate component and informs the Workstation when/if the component complies with the command directive.</li>
<li>The Workstation component is the Researcher's window into the Picto system. It includes a <a class="el" href="class_remote_viewer.html" title="This allows Operators to view and control a remotely running Experimental Session. ">RemoteViewer</a> which Researchers use to start/stop Experimental sessions, control them and monitor their activity. It includes a <a class="el" href="class_state_edit_viewer.html" title="The StateEditViewer is a container for the Designer widget which is a development environment for cre...">StateEditViewer</a>, used to design the Experiment that runs on the <a class="el" href="class_director.html" title="Defines an object that runs a Picto Experiment for a test subject, transmits experimental data to the...">Director</a> and the Analysis that is used to extract data from session files. It includes a <a class="el" href="class_test_viewer.html" title="This allows designers to run the Experiment/Analysis that they are creating in a test environment for...">TestViewer</a> for locally testing and debugging Experimental designs and Analyses. Lastly, the Workstation includes a <a class="el" href="class_replay_viewer.html" title="Defines the UI for the ReplayViewer. ">ReplayViewer</a> which is used to playback Session files, record Session activity to a video file, and run Session Analyses.</li>
</ul>
<p>While Neurobiological research is the main focus on the application suite, we have made every effort to design it in such a way that it will be generalizable and extendable for other types of applications as well. In this vain, and for the purpose of training users, the suite can be used without an attached Proxy component. In its essence, Picto is a system for designing and running experiments consisting of precisely timed, carefully controlled stimuli and user feedback with an optional capability for tracking neurobiological data and aligning it with the behavioral stream.</p>

Prerequisites</h1>
<p>This document assumes that the reader has experience with C++ based software development and is familiar with the Qt framework. Many many details and tutorials about getting started with C++ and Qt are available online. We also assume that the reader has a basic level of comfort with the command-line interface, as it will be used to prepare a build environment.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="devdocs_getting_started"></a>
Getting Started</h1>
<p>In order to get up to speed with Picto development, you will need to create a development environment, become familiar with the various files used in the Picto system and familiarize yourself with the code base. The following pages should help guide you through these tasks.</p><ul>
<li><a class="el" href="build_environment_preparation.html">Create a Picto Development Environment</a> - Use this page to set up your development environment to build and edit Picto code.</li>
<li><a class="el" href="user_files.html">Understand Picto User Files</a> - Use this page to gain a broad understanding of the files used generated and used by Picto.</li>
<li><a class="el" href="first_code_look.html">First Look At Code</a> - Use this as a guide to becoming familiar with the Picto code base.</li>
</ul>
