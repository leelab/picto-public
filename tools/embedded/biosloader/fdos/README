FREEDOS Ripcord BootDisk
This is a basic boot disk intended for basic DOS use,
and not intended for use to install a FreeDOS distribution.
USE OF THIS DISK IS AT YOUR OWN RISK

This boot disk is auto generated about once a week.
Some portions (such as the Kernel) are built from latest
source or latest downloadable binary, whereas other portions
are manually updated.  An archive with all source (to satisfy
various license requirements, e.g. GPL) should be available
with the disk/disk image.  You should obtain it at the
same time, as only the latest available boot disk and source
archive are provided.

Goals:
This disk (image) should be bootable by any computer 
supported by FreeDOS (8086+ IBM compatible PC), however
certain additions may require a 80286, 80386 or newer system.
It is my hope that disk may be useful for BIOS flashing
(please use default BARE mode), playing 'classic' DOS games,
system recovery, OEM use (just add your program), etc.

Please use the FreeDOS lists if you need assistance.
