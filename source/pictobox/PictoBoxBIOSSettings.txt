====================================

In an attempt to save myself from future pain, I am documenting the BIOS 
settings of PictoBox.  This list is current as of Feb 3, 2010, and the 
listed settings seemed to work when running Windows XP from an external 
hard disk.  Obviously, some settings might need to be changed for other setups
but at least this is one setup that works.
